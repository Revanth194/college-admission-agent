# 🎓 College Admission Agent – AI-Powered Chatbot for Student Queries

An AI-powered assistant designed to help prospective students get instant, document-based answers about college admissions using IBM Watsonx.ai and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The agent responds to questions about eligibility, course options, fees, application deadlines, and more — all from real college admission documents.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Students and parents often struggle to find accurate and timely information during the college admission process. Details about eligibility, fees, important dates, and course options are scattered across websites or documents, leading to confusion and delays.
